      Raised on sweet tea, bacon, and video games.. My journey started in a small town in West Virginia, but my aspirations were much larger. I have always considered myself a "jack of all trades" and can say that I have worked in quite a few different fields during my lifetime. Shortly after completing college in 201, I relocated to Pittsburgh, PA with hopes of working in sports at the professional or collegiate level. While applying for jobs in my dream field and navigating interviews (for over 7 years), I worked a wonderful job in the juvenile justice field. Just about everyone that has worked in the non-profit sector can vouch for this, I wore so many "hats" during my time there. <br /> Fast forward to January 2020, decided that I wanted to take on a new challenge and switch careers. As an avid gamer, I always had an interest in how games were made, so I applied to Academy Pittsburgh and began my journey. Two weeks into the program, the Covid-19 Pandemic struck, making my decision to begin this journey a lot easier. I resigned from my previous career and jumped into learning to code. Navigating the pandemic is/was tough enough, but successfully completing Academy Pittsburgh was a major accomplishment. Besides being a huge time commitment, the program also introduced us to many programming languages and each seemed to come with varying degree of difficulty. A few months after completing the bootcamp, I realized how difficult it was going to be to enter the workforce in this new path without prior experience. Decided to build a website and forward it to a company that was just about to launch. This company was owned by a gentleman with 20+ years of experience as a software developer and I was just seeking mentorship and to network at the time. Building that website led me to the position that I am in today.      </SectionText>
